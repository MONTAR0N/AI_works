7 Maximum memory capacity may require the replacement of standard component with largest supported 
 component available. Even though it 
is possible to physically install 4GB of memory , the actual amount of memory addressable by a 32-bit operating system will be limited to 3GB. This limitation does not exist with  64-bit operating systems.8 Hard drive: GB = billion bytes, 
 TB = trillion bytes. Accessible capacity is 
less; up to 4GB is service partition. 
9 Service upgrade  options: 
 Upgrades do not apply to com ponents 
covered for 90 days.  Those remain at 90-day warranty

connection will be based on the access point to which it connects.
12 Limited warranty: Support unrelated to a warranty issue may be subject to 
 additional charges.
13 Onsite Service: If a machine is listed as having “On-site” , this me ans that on-site 
service is available for the replacement of parts for warranty repairs. Certain parts, referred to as Customer Replace-able Unit (“CRU”) parts, are easy to install and require little or no tools or technical knowledge. Some examples of CRU parts are mice, keyboards, hard disk drives, speakers, and memory . If your 
problem can be resolved with a CRU, the Support Center will offer to ship the part to you for you to install.
14 Included software may differ from its retail version (if available), and may not include user manuals or all program functionality . Software license agree-ments may apply .
15 Modem speeds: Public network 
download speeds are limited to 53Kbps. Upload speeds are limited to 48Kbps for V .92 modems. Actual speeds depend on many factors and are often less than the maximum possible. V .92 functions and speeds require compatible phone line
