  Lenovo Graphic Adapters
What	are	the	benefits	of	a	Graphic	 Adapter?
•	It	helps	users	make	the	most	of	Windows	Vista	–	the	first	Windows	OS	that	can	harness	the	power	of	an	available	graphics		 	
	 processor	to	give	a	premium	3D	user	experience	via	the	Windows	Vista	 Aero	interface.
•	It	can	improve	productivity	by	enabling	connection	of	multiple	monitors	to	the	same	PC.	More	data	can	be	viewed	across		 	
	 screens	and	faster	access	to	multiple	open	windows	is	possible.•	It	allows	the	system	processor	to	concentrate	on	non-graphic	tasks,	making	applications	run	faster.•	A	TV-Out	feature	permits,	for	example,	video	to	be	edited	at	a	user’s	PC	with	the	resulting	out	put	being	viewed	on	a	 TV.
•	It	enables	connectivity	to	high-definition	monitors,	projectors	and	 TVs.
•	Improved	display	performance	through	better	colour	fidelity	and	smoother	video	playback	make	a	graphic	adapter	the		 		 answer	for	users	working	on	graphic-intensive	tasks,	such	as	desk	top	publishing,	animation,	video	editing	and	image		 		 processing,	as	well	as	scientific,	mapping	and	engineering	(eg.	CAD/CAM)	applications.
Which	Graphic	 Adapter	is	right	for	your	desktop	system?
*	The	DVI-I	Video	Connection 	Adapter	is	not	a	proper	graphic	adapter, 	since	it	uses	the	on-board 	(integrated) 	video	subsystem. 	However,	 	
		it	is	the	simplest 	way	to	support	a	second	monitor	on	desktop	systems.
*	USFF	is	not	customer	installableLenovo®	recommends	Windows®	7	Professional.

Service	delivery	definitions
All	Lenovo	hardware	products	are	delivered	with	base	warranty	which	is	an	integral	part	of	the	system	specifications.	Lenovo	provides	customers	with	a	manufacturer’s	warranty	against	faulty	workmanship	or	defective	parts,	providing	that	the	product	receives	normal	use.	 The	length	and	service	comfort	level	are	given	by	machine	
type	and	cannot	be	downgraded.	 The	warranty	period	starts	with	the	date	when	the	product	is	sold	to	the	end	
customer	(proof	of	purchase	date)	and	covers	all	parts	and	labour	for	a	given	warranty	period,	mostly	one	or	three	years.	The	length	of	the	warranty	period	extension	or	upgrade	may	be	up	to	maximum	5	years.

The	problem	determination	aim	is	to	identify	whether	
the	problem	resides	with	the	customer’s	Lenovo	machine	or	whether	the	reason	might	be	caused	by	other	machines	or	software.

Under	Customer	Carry-in 	or	Mail-in 	repair,	the	product	will	be	repaired	or	exchanged	at	a	designated	service	
center,	with	delivery	or	shipping	arranged	by	customer.	Customer	is	responsible	to	deliver	or	mail,	as	their	Service	
Provider	specifies,	(prepaid	by	you	unless	specified	otherwise)	the	product,	suitably	packaged	to	a	designated	location.	 After	the	product	has	been	repaired	or	exchanged,	it	will	be	made	available	for	Customers’ 	collection.

or	exchange,	Lenovo	will	arrange	the	delivery	of	the	repaired	 ThinkPad	to	the	same	customer’s	location	where	it
