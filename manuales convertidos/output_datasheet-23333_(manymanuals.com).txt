(O-IP) July 2010IdeaPad™ Accessories         Personal Systems Reference (PSREF) Availability: All offers subject to 
availability . Lenovo reserves the right to alter product offer ings and speciﬁ  cations 
at any time, without notice. Lenovo is not responsible for photographic or typographic errors.
 Warranty: For a copy of applicable 
product warranties, write to: Warranty Information, P .O. Box 12195, RTP , NC, 
27709, Attn: Dept ZPY A/B676. Lenovo makes no representation or warranty regarding third party products or services.
 Footnotes:
1 Power management, including Intel® 
SpeedStep® T echnology , reduces 
 processor speed when in battery mode.
2 Weight includes battery and standard optical drive; weight may vary due to vendor components, manufacturing process and options.
3 Thinness may vary at certain points on the system.
4 Wireless capability: Requires com-patible wireless-enabled options sold separately .
5 Post-warranty annual maintenance agreement: Service begins at the end of the base warranty or the end of any other applied warranty and maintenance option, whichever occurs last. Service delivery is not available the same day the maintenance agreement is purchased. Maintenance agreements must be purchased and the registration success-fully completed prior to the service b eing 
available.
6 Public network download modem speeds are limited to 53Kbps. Upload speeds are limited to 48Kbps for V .92 modems.  Actual speeds depend on many factors and are often less than the maximum possible. V .92 functions and speeds require compatible phone line and server equipment. Check with your  
telephone and ISP service providers for 
availability . 
7 Maximum memory capacity may require the replacement of standard component with largest supported 
 component available. On systems, even 
though it is possible to physically install 4GB of memory , the actual amount of memory addressable by a 32-bit operating system will be limited to 3GB. This limitation does not exist with  64-bit operating systems.8 Hard drive: GB = billion bytes, 
 TB = trillion bytes. Accessible capacity is 
less; up to 4GB is service partition. 
9 Service upgrade options: Service period begins with the equipment date of purchase. Service must be purchased during the original limited product war-ranty period. Service levels are response time objectives and are not guarantees. 
10 Battery: These model nu mbers achieved 
the battery life based on MobileMark® 
2007 during testing. Battery life (and recharge times) will vary based on many factors including screen brigh tness, ap-
plications, features, power management, battery conditioning, and other customer preferences. 
11 Wireless: Based on IEEE 802. 1 1a, 802. 1 1b, and 802. 1 1g respectively . An adapter with 1 1a/b, 1 1b/g, or 1 1a/b/g can communicate on either/any of these listed format s respectively , the actual 
connection will be based on the access point to which it connects.
12 Limited warranty: Support unrelated to a warranty issue may be subject to 
 additional charges.
13 Onsite Repair: If a machine is listed as having “On-site” , this me ans that on-site 
service is available for the replacement of parts for warranty repairs. Certain parts, referred to as Customer Replace-able Unit (“CRU”) parts, are easy to install and require little or no tools or technical knowledge. Some examples of CRU parts are mice, keyboards, hard disk drives, speakers, and memory . If your 
problem can be resolved with a CRU, the Support Center will offer to ship the part to you for you to install.
14 Included software may differ from its retail version (if available), and may not include user manuals or all program functionality . Software license agree-ments may apply .
15 Modem speeds: Public network 
download speeds are limited to 53Kbps. Upload speeds are limited to 48Kbps for V .92 modems. Actual speeds depend on many factors and are often less than the maximum possible. V .92 functions and speeds require compatible phone line 
 and server equipment. Check with your  
telephone and ISP service providers for availability . 16 Response times may vary. May exclude 
some holidays. T elephone support may 
be subject to additional charges.
17 International Warranty Service is avail-able for most products in any country in which this product is sold and serviced. Service delivery methods and parts avail-ability vary by co untry , may be different 
from that in the country of pur chase, and 
are subject to change without notice. Fees and restrictions may apply in some countries. 
18 Telephone support may be subject to additional charges, even during the limit-ed warranty period. Response times may vary and may exclude some holidays.
